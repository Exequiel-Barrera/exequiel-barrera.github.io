    <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths Exploration</h1>

    <h2 class="question" id="first">
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h2>
    <p class="answer" id="first">
      I had to decide whether to report a colleague who was stealing diesel from
      diesel from my work place and it was only him and I that night. I weighed
      the value of honesty against the potential consequences for my colleague.
      I chose to report the situation, believing that integrity was more
      important than protecting someone's feelings or personal interest. In
      hindsight, I feel it was the right decision, as it upheld my values and
      maintained a fair work environment, besides the fact it was going to come
      back to me by the time they would have found out, and my job feeds my
      family and pay my bills, nobody else does it, so i have to look after my
      own interests too
    </p>

    <h2 class="question2" id="second">
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h2>
    <p class="question2" id="second">
      My culture and the people around me have greatly
    </p>

    <h2 class="question3" id="third">
      Identify your strenghts and how they will support you during your learning
      journey
    </h2>
    <p class="question3" id="third">
      My strengths include my strong work ethic, adaptability, and willingness
      to learn. These qualities will support me during my learning journey by
      allowing me to stay focused on my goals, adjust to new challenges, and
      continuously seek knowledge and improvement. I believe that these
      strengths will help me overcome obstacles and achieve success in my
      career.
    </p>

    <h2 class="question4" id="fourth">
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h2>
    <p class="question4" id="fourth">
      My limitations include a tendency to procrastinate and difficulty in
      managing my time effectively. These limitations might affect my learning
      journey by causing me to fall behind on assignments or miss deadlines. To
      overcome these challenges, I plan to implement better time management
      strategies, such as setting specific goals and breaking tasks into
      smaller, manageable steps. Also English as a second language is sort of a
      limitation for me in some cases, since it can be easy to misunderstand a
      concept or idea, just because I don't know the meaning of a word or
      phrase, so I have to be careful with that and make sure I understand what
      is being said or asked before answering or doing something.
    </p>

    <h2 class="question5" id="fifth">
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why
    </h2>

    <p class="question5" id="fifth">
      An example of when I was trying to work productively with others but faced
      resistance was during a group project at work. There were differing
      opinions on how to approach the project, which led to tension among team
      members. At the time, I tried to facilitate open communication and
      encourage everyone to share their ideas, but it didn't resolve the
      conflict. In hindsight, I would try to establish clear roles and
      responsibilities from the beginning and set up regular check-ins to ensure
      everyone is on the same page. This would help prevent misunderstandings
      and keep the team focused on our common goals.Apart from asking each one
      how would they feel about the project and what they would like to do, I
      would also try to find out what each one is good at and assign them tasks
      accordingly, so that way they can feel more comfortable with the project
      and be more productive.
