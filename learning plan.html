<h2 class="question" id="first">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
 <p class="answer" id="first">I want to achieve a career in software development, that allows me to support my family  and have a stable income. 
  I want to be able to work on projects that interest me and allow me to grow my skills.</p>

<h2 class="question2" id="second">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
<p class="question2" id= "second">One my strengths is my strong willingness to learn and adapt to new situations. I found myself at the same time easy to work with others and to work independently.</p>

<h2 class="question3" id="third">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
<p class="question3" id="third"> I would say decision-maker skill; which for me personally it can be a little bit of too much overthinking, and as result as waste some sort of time on evaluation the important facts and not just superficial ones before making the decision.  </p>

<h2 class="question4" id="fourth">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>


<h2 class="question4-1" id="fourth-1">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h2>
<p class="question4-1" id="fourth-1">I will manage myself by being respectful and open-minded to others' ideas and opinions. I will also be proactive in seeking help when needed and offering help to others when I can.</p>

<h2 class="question 4-2" id="fourth-2">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
<p class="question4-2" id="fourth-2">When things are building up, I will take a step back and assess the situation. I will prioritise my tasks and focus on the most important ones first. If I feel overwhelmed, I will take a break and come back to it with a fresh perspective.</p>

<h2 class="question5" id="fifth">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
<p class="question5" id="fifth"> I would seek for help everytime i see that i am making the sort of the same mistake, since this is what it could 
  happen sometimes when you are trying to find the answer by yourself, and you are not sure if you are on the right track or not. I would also seek help from my peers and facilitators when I am stuck on a problem or need clarification on a concept.</p>
</p>


<h2 class="question6" id="sixth">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
<p class="question6" id="sixth">I expect the Facilitation team to be supportive and provide guidance when needed. I also expect them to challenge me to think critically and push me out of my comfort zone. I hope they will provide constructive feedback on my work and help me improve my skills.</p>

<h2 class="question7" id="seventh">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in</h2>
<p class="question7" id="seventh">I might have a committment out of the routine when my family from back home come to visit us; my mum and dad who i have not seen in 7 years. and hopefully they will be here by end of october. which it wont stop me for doing my course
  , i will just have to manage my time better and be more organised. Basically most of my study i do,it is at work during my breaks, so when i get back home i have time for everyone else</p>
