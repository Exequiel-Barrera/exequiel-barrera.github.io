      <h2>Questions sprint 1</h2>

      <h3>Name 5 commands you used, and what they do</h3>

      <p>1.cd: to move up or down different directories 2.ls:to see file that existe in the current directory 3.pwd: to see in which directory i was 4.mkdir: create new directory or folder 5.touch:creation of an empty with an specific name you wish to</p>

      <h3>Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</h3>

      <p>No estrictly to the ones established, i would say in some parts i spent more time trying to understand and memorize the concepts </p>

      <h3>Did you learn anything unexpected?</h3>

      <p> Yes, I did.</p>

      <h3>What's the difference between git and GitHub? </h3>
      
      <p>Git is designed to track and manage changes in your code. Allowing you save different version of your projects. Also designed to work in collaboration with others. On the other hand Github, offers a cloud-based platform for hosting git repos, so that others can collaborate in the process</p>
      
      <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe them?</h3>

      <p>From my understanding i would say Git it is like the local car workshop in town , and GitHUb is like the worlwide car brand where exist multiple teams that work together.</p>

      <h3>Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?</h3>
      
      <p> I might do.</p>

      <h3>Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?</h3>

      <p>I tried to , but always i would say it took me longer of what they suggested.</p>

      <h3>What is a Git workflow?</h3>

      <p>it is the process of developing code changes in collaboration using Git. it defines where developers can create, branch, merge, and deploy code efficiently.</p>

      <h3>What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</h3>
      
      <p>I noticed that sometimes i needed the media aspect apart from just the reading, in order to complement my understanding process, like visually see it to understand it better. I googled up my confusion , and sometimes i took little break and came back to analiza the issue from a different point</p>

      <h3>Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</h3>

      <p>I dont think so , since this is pretty much all new for me . All i could think about it, just i would have spent some time previous to the course, learnig the concepts and how other softwares operate be more familiar with them, to maximize time consuming looking for multiple location or functions in it.</p>
      
     <h3>How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?</h3>

      <p>like saving your progress in your game, but with having the chance to get back to previous progress.</p>

      <h3>What is main?</h3>
      
      <p>it is most perfect well-tested version of your code. and where it seats and it runs properly</p>

      <h3>Why create a Branch?</h3>
      
      <p>because it helps to avoid accidentally overwritting other people's code, and also to avoid adding bugs into good code</p>

      <h3>Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?</h3>

      <p>sometimes confusing in terms of understanding the significants differences between each others. like what could be the consequences if that is not done or created properly.</p>

      <h3>What are some examples of when you would fork?</h3>

     <p>i would say when the intention is to improve an existing code file that is working fine, and we dont want to bug the project. also when we are not 100% certain if our ideas would work on an existing projects we didnt develop</p>
     
     <h3>Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?</h3>

     <p>I don't know if everything clicked in one big understanding process. since i constantly keep trying to connect the previous concepts with new one, and i think more doubts comes to me like ...what if i would do it this way, what would happen with the file? also because i have been working from different devices. I could forget in which stage of progress i was and then double up things or files...</p>
     
     <h3>Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?</h3>
     
     <p>i felt frustated on the kowaikoe challenge nearly at the end of it, since i could push to origing the new branch created, since already had ir created. But i could combine process together in order to the right result. since i started the challenge on my first device and then jumped to the 2nd one to finish it off, but then lost orientation of what i was doing. probably a good things learn to manage because in somehow working on somebody's else project involves to have the ability to understand where the project is aiming to and learn how to connect with this one efficiently.</p>
     
     <h3>If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?</h3>
    
     <p>i had a sort of vague idea, also i would call it little big of ignorant. Thinking that for software developing you needed advanced level of maths. which from my preconceptions still has a high level of algorithms. in somehow is require to have an order to be followed properly in order to get the right result.</p>
     
     <h3>What is your process so far for solving problems?</h3>

     <p>i think that i still have learn to break into small steps in order to get to the root of the problem. Sometimes i tend to focus on too many things at the beginning, and that just makes it more confusing and stressful.</p>
    
     <h3>Have a look at what the internet says on how to think like a programmer. What patterns do you see? What do you notice?</h3>

     <p>learning to communicate is essential if we want to learn how to break down complex problem into small ones. Besides to help you to communicate effectively with other programmers when you need help with problems. being able to reflect about it and talk through the problem loud is also an useful way can help to understand problem better. Learn when to take a break and step back from problem.</p>
     
     <h3>What does the internet say about flipped learning? What is flipped learning and flipped classroom? How do you think it will relate to your learning journey?</h3>

     <p>Internet says flipped learning is a a methodology that helps teachers to prioritize active learning during class time by assigning students lecture materials and presentations to be viewed at home or outside of class flipped classroom students acquire knowledge before the class and use classroom time to practive and apply concepts and share ideas with others and teachers.

         I think the methodology applied in this learning journey is related to flipped learning, since we have been given the material explanation and didactic material for us to read and process prior to put it into practice, so by the time is require , we are able to analyze and develop the project in a meaningful way where we can learn more at the same time and able to share new ideas or concepts with others. We are developing sort of our own learning process, but guided by the handbook with the concepts and explanation which is supported by the facilitator at the time we have to achieve the tasks.</p>

<h3>What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?</h3>     

<p>I  felt like i was not in the right fit. Specially when you read other people already have a pre or related background with what you are about to learn. Because then you wonder , why people would want to team up with somebody that has 0 knowledge of the subject when the idea is always team up with others than can push to progress in a sort fast- consequent way and not just dragging the progress slowly. i think that at the end, everyone wants to succeed on what they are learning and doing , so personal interests would always come first</p>

<h3>Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?</h3>

<p>I think healthy self conscious can give you the right motivation , but in this case just tried to be as honest as i could commenting something about me.</p>

<h3>In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?</h3>
      
      <p>I would describe it like an efficient direct-fast way to navigate or run your computer. In terms of analogy i would say it could be like the differences between driving a manual car in comparison with an automatic one. which a manual car can be more fuel-efficient than an automatic. 
         well command line can be more time-efficient to get tasks done when you have the practice and knowledge of the right commands.And time nowadays is equal money. So in the long run we are doing some savings too.</p>

      <h3>What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?</h3>

        <p> i faced frustration not knowing from where to start looking for a proper solution to my problems. 
         We know that i could just message the facilitator, but i thinnk the idea is to learn to solve problem by yourself most of the time.</p>

      <h3>How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</h3>

        <p> I get confident when i achieved the purpose of tasks. When i managed complete the tasks following the instructions properly. 
        However, if i get stuck or i dont get the result i should. Well, sort of doubt of what i already know and i start going back again to reinforce it
        </p>

      <h3>Which parts of the work did you enjoy?</h3>

        <p>I enjoyed the Branch and merge challenge: Ko Wai Koe, since i felt like it was a more long project to work on the terminal. 
        so everytime i was trying to fix some error, it was showing at the same time what i have learnt at the same time in terms of command and process, 
        besides of showing what i was doing wrong.</p>

      <h3>Which parts of the work did you find tedious?</h3>

        <p>i wouldn't say any part. since i am taking everything like big whole learning process where every subject or topic is needed in order to get the final results.</p>
    
    <h3>id you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?</h3>
    
    <p>Yes, I did. Just making me wondering if it was the right choice and if i was going to be able to achieve the goals of the course properly. 
      Also make question if i had too much on my plate already to keep carry on with my day by day responsabilities. 
      However, I think those voices or thoughts can work out on positive way when at that moment you walk a way, breath and have a deep thinking about who you are,what you are capable of, what you have achieved in all these years. and finally you are able to look at yourself as a person capable of this and much more. Specially when you have family or people that counts on you and your effort will be safety and support for their future too.</p>

      <h2>Questions sprint 2</h2>

<h3>Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?</h3>

<p>i went on my terminal to the directory where i have my repo for the github blog and there created a directory calle "blog" where i created a html file that is the template of the blog then stage, commit and push this one to my github repo. After when back to the directory where my github repo is and i created a new directory called "styles" where i a created a file inside of this one called " main.css" Finally after that i went back to my html file in github repo directory to link my new css, for that i open my html file and i copied the link provided.</p>

<h3>How are you finding working with the timeboxes?</h3>

<p>i think it works ok when you start having a better understanding of process you need to get through in order to succeed with the task. Otherwise times can vary a bit getting stuck on procedures doesnt let you carry on. And I would say , most of us like to get this done and know why is not working the way it should before we walk away</p>

<h3>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</h3>

<p>i went through few obstacles during the CSS and HTML basic learning exercises guide or tutorial through freecodecamp. specially with the amount of different combinations of codes to memorize or learn in order to modify or gite some style to your web design. Whenever i got stuck i went through the hints option or google the problem where i found other discussion forum with the solution and explanation why it should be like that</p>

<h3>What are you proud of from this challenge? </h3>

<p>i am proud the times i got stuck and i felt frustrated, i was able to take a break and then rethink the problem in order to find the proper solution. Some cases i walked away for the day i came up the next day with new possible solutions.</p>
    
<h3>What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?</h3>

<p>I noticed that for me i need to have that sort relation between visual learning and practising it. it was good to have the option of watching what he was doing, but at the same time is good to be trying doing the same at the same time. I realized also that hard to hold to much processes when it is something completely new for me. As limitations, i found it was quite intensive amount of content and processes to diggest in 51 min.</p>

<h3>Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</h3>

<p>yes they did, and basically what i did when it happened , it was to do something different instead for a bit and then went back to the tutorial videos few minutes back so i could re-watch that part again and sort of listenning to it with a different mind set.</p>

<h3>How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?</h3>

<p>i have 7 tabs open . which out of those 7 only 2 were distractions one( 3d designs pages)</p>

<h3>Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.</h3>

<p>i did change some titles. I would sayb the arrow in the box on the right top corner is really useful and handy to sort of understand where every part of the coding is .</p>

<h3>Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.</h3>

<p>More than a story for me , i do understand HTML and CSS under an Analogy that both complement each other creating and designing web pages. Based on their dynamics and visually modifications, can make this web pages more attractives for everyone who gets involved or work witht them.</p>

<h3>Any moments of surprise or joy?</h3>

<p>As a joy moments. i would say when you can see that you are able to put your ideas in the codes in order to modify or personalised your blog the way you wanted.</p>

<h3>If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</h3>

<p>I think that they could be any animal that they work together for a common purpose or goals, like aninamls in herds. They sort of have an hierarchy in their living groups, where some of them have different responsabilities than others, but at the end all add up in one main results that benefit everyone.</p>

<h3>How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?</h3>

<p>I still find myself i can start some ideas and designing, but soon i get stuck for next steps or some modifications, which brings me back to watch more tutorials and do more research about the topic.</p>

<h3>Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?</h3>

<p>Once you start designing and seeing those modifications taking place in just how do you want them to be</p>

<h3>Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?</h3>

<p>Trying to get exactly they way you pictured in your mind, in terms of the concepts and designing. sometimes feeling lacking of a bit of creativity</p>

<h3>How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?</h3>

<p>Sometimes made me feel i was capable of doing just need it to step back for a bit and come back with others ideas to try out. I think this beginning is about trying out multiple possibilities on creation and designing in order to understand how it works in sometimes.</p>

<h3>If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?</h3>

<p>I would say, there multiples way, but the one i learnt is using code editor, visual studio code and i would suggest the same media material i have saved for him to watch and practice.</p>

<section id="sprint 3" class="card">
      <h2>Questions sprint 3</h2>

  <h3>Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?</h3>

   <p>I do believe and I agree with mindulfness in such a way that nowadays we live our lives in such a rush  for  whatever we are thinking at that time or willing to do, that in some cases we lose our capacity of appreciation and really enjoy the present and who is around us by that time.</p>

<h3>How did you find the overall experience?</h3>

<p>it was actually sort of mind opener to express it in somehow, it is helpful to understand why do we think that way and what is the best practices for ourselves in terms of developing a healthy mindset and habits.</p>

<h3>What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? </h3>

<p>I want to commit myself to try meditation as a way to start the my day , and cultivate different sort of thoughts on me before we start worrying and overthinking the usual things we do or i do everyday.</p>

<h3>What was it like to be fully listened to?</h3>

<p>It feels like you want to keep sharing, thoughts, ideas, memories or just simples words with that person. I think encourage the conversation to be more fluid and not so ambiguous.</p>

<h3>What was it like to fully listen?</h3>

<p>It was like really caring for the others. Like you are focus on what you hear and at the same time you are imaging what the other person is saying like it was you who was experiencing that fact.</p>

<h3>What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?</h3>

<p>I noticed, that i had to find different ways to understand what it was explained in most of the cases, since i could not create the right logic to process the information and concepts. I think still for me they are too many "why" when  and what questions before i can understand fully a concept without self doubting of what i know.</p>

<h3>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?</h3>

<p>yes it was difficult for me, i still believe for the fact of being something completely new for me, it is always too much info to process at once and to remember all next. Like i can compare when i started learning English; always so much grammar and vocabulary to remember in order to speak the proper way
</p>

<h3>How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?</h3>

<p>I think it was a meaningful exercise for me in terms of association of concepts and seeing them working properly, having a clear idea how these ones are related between each others.
Besides, i consider more easy to understand when somebody is explaining to you directly and showes you the proper examples and we are not just reading and trying to process somebody that we never saw or dealt with before.</p>

<h3>What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?</h3>

<p>Sadly, i realised that is quite complex topic for me as first time interacting and learnign this sort of contents and still i have a lot of practice to do in order for me to understand the logic behind it. 
I did realise as well, that there will be some codes structures that must be memorized or know by heart , by the time we know when to use them
</p>


<h3>Which parts of this sprint made you angry?</h3>

<p>just not being able to understand some concepts or principles on coding that found hard to associate with more clear example, not just examples of coding examples.
</p>

<h3>How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?</h3>

<p>to be honest i do not know if i could say giving up, but started wondering if probable needed to be more involved with the subjects before i decided to start this course. </p>

<section id="sprint 4" class="card">
      <h2>Questions sprint 4</h2>

<h3>What was it like to be fully listened to?</h3>

<p>It feels like you want to keep sharing, thoughts, ideas, memories or just simples words with that person. I think encourage the conversation to be more fluid and not so ambiguous.
Beside the fact , create a mutual feelings in order to listen to others in the same way.
</p>

<h3>What was it like to listen fully?</h3>

<p>I think sometimes you might be able to listen concentration on what the other person is saying , not just for whatever could be surrounding you or distracting you at that time, but concentrating on what the other person is saying, could make start thinking about something in particular about what that person said, and then you sort of lose track of the rest, since you are still overthinking about what he or she said, or even imagine the situation that she or he was describing .</p>

<h3>What makes code more readable for you?</h3>

<p>i would say when this one is divided clearly into the categories or subcategories in it. like nesting </p>

<h3>Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?</h3>

<p>I would prefer tabs</p>

<h3>What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?</h3>

<p>I would say the more we start typing we start finding a way to make ourselves more clear in terms of reading the code. So i have been learning to give the text or line the right spaces and tabs in order for me to be easy to find these ones at the end.</p>

<h3>Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`:</h3>

<p>function sum (a,b) {
  return a+b;
}
```
function sum() {
  if (sum(2, 3) === 5) {
    console.log("It works!");
  }
}
```</p>
<h3>Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?</h3>

<p>i am not sure since i dont get how it works properly yet, like how to use it on my side</p>

<h3>How did you find using the tests? Confusing? Useful?</h3>

<p>Confusing , specially with trying or checking if they were or not</p>

<h3>What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?</h3>

<p>just googling every time i was getting stuck on something</p>

<h3>What was the most challenging part of Super FlipFlop for you?</h3>

<p>trying to understand the logic and remember how to use it properly</p>

<h3> Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?</h3>

<p>Not really just re-read it to go through logic again and sort of understand it better</p>

<h3> Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?</h3>

<p>javascript, the more i read about it i feel like less i knowor i can remember about previous content.</p>

<h3>How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?</h3>

<p>breaks mainly, sticking to my break time at work to put all the focus and effort on it</p>

<h3>f you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? </h3>

<p>start learnig full basic course on javascript </p>

<section id="sprint 5" class="card">
      <h2>Questions sprint 5</h2>

      <h3> What are the three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to human skills learning?</h3>

      <p>I have learnt new ways to face some problem solving, using different sort of techniques  and how to canalise frustration in a way that it won't affect my motivation and dedication to mys tasks</p>

<h3>What are the role of the values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

<p> I think empathy plays an important role work on teams being able to listen to and support teammates improving communication and help to insert diverse perspectives.
   Regarding Self-awareness it is always useful knowing your own triggers and habits helps you develop strategies (like taking breaks or using debugging tools) instead of burning out.
</p>

<h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning</h3>

<p>the way they are connected or necesary to develop in order to succeed in what you are achiving to do or learn. they are basically the foundation for learning to be sustainable and impactful</p>

<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills Learning?</h3>

<p> I would say more than knowing them is putting them into practice, like  True empathy means not just ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù but actually adjusting your behavior based on another person‚Äôs needs or perspective. </p>

<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>

<p>In order to prepare people not just on what they know; teaching syntax, but also preparing them to face the outside environment working on teams, dealing with problems that can take a lot out of ourselves, managing frustration
  being able to work and communicate effectively which it will make ourselves good candidates by the time we want to look for employment.

<h3>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

<p>No it did not. Since we dont work in isolation, we require to work in teams, communicate to others be self aware. Values that we need in order for us to become a fully completed developer i would call it.</p>
