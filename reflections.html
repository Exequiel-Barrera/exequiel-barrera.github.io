      <h2>Questions sprint 1</h2>

      <h3>What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?</h3>

        <p> i faced frustration not knowing from where to start looking for a proper solution to my problems. 
         We know that i could just message the facilitator, but i thinnk the idea is to learn to solve problem by yourself most of the time.</p>

      <h3>How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</h3>

        <p> I get confident when i achieved the purpose of tasks. When i managed complete the tasks following the instructions properly. 
        However, if i get stuck or i dont get the result i should. Well, sort of doubt of what i already know and i start going back again to reinforce it
        </p>

      <h3>Which parts of the work did you enjoy?</h3>

        <p>I enjoyed the Branch and merge challenge: Ko Wai Koe, since i felt like it was a more long project to work on the terminal. 
        so everytime i was trying to fix some error, it was showing at the same time what i have learnt at the same time in terms of command and process, 
        besides of showing what i was doing wrong.</p>

      <h3>Which parts of the work did you find tedious?</h3>

        <p>i wouldn't say any part. since i am taking everything like big whole learning process where every subject or topic is needed in order to get the final results.</p>
    
    <h3>id you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?</h3>
    
    <p>Yes, I did. Just making me wondering if it was the right choice and if i was going to be able to achieve the goals of the course properly. 
      Also make question if i had too much on my plate already to keep carry on with my day by day responsabilities. 
      However, I think those voices or thoughts can work out on positive way when at that moment you walk a way, breath and have a deep thinking about who you are,what you are capable of, what you have achieved in all these years. and finally you are able to look at yourself as a person capable of this and much more. Specially when you have family or people that counts on you and your effort will be safety and support for their future too.</p>
