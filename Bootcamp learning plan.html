      <h2>Questions </h2>

  <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

   <h3>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for</h3>
    
    <p> I will be using it on every tasks or challenge that comes along with this part of course</p>

   <h3> What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy?</h3>
     <p> I would like to have that brilliant idea that is going to create or open a door of new opportunity
         for people, and make life easier for them. It sounds cheesy, but I want to have that knowledge that I made a difference in someone's life.
     </p>
  
     <h3>Do you have a destination in mind?</h3>

     <p>No , i don't have like a straight fully focus destination, at the very beginning of this journey, i just want opportunities, and i will always 
      grateful to have one that will lead to another one in the future </p>

  <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>

    <p> In terms of my strenghts, i will be determine to finish the tasks or challenge that we will be required to, 
        but also i will be always willing to be a good team player and listening as well as respect other people opinions and ideas</p>
  
    <p> In terms of my limitations, i think it will be my time management, because I have a job that demands 12hrs shift a day or night, 
        so i could be finding a little bit of difficulty orgnizing time to meet witgh others team mates, even sometimes not much time to finish my own tasks,
        but i will be doing my best to manage my time wisely</p>

  <h2>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations?</h2>
      
      
        <p> Not really, since a lot of my routine and responsabilities are still the same, for same reason i still some day struggle to find
            time to do my tasks, but i think that eventually i should learn to manage my time better, besides that my knowledge and skills will be improving, which it means that
            i should not be struggling that much to understand the tasks or challenges that we will be given.
        </p>
  
  <h3> Have you discovered any new ones during this course?</h3>
        
        <p>I would not say that i have discovered, but i have proved myself in some how, that i still can overcome,
          certain obstacles that i thought i could not do it, like for example, learning new skills and knowledge that i thought
          it was going to be hard for me, but i did it, so i guess that is a new strenght that i have discovered in myself. I am not an expert
          but i am willing to put the effort to learn and improve myself.
        </p>

  <h3>How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</h3>
        
    <p> I think it will help me in a way to keep going with this new learning curve, apart from keep myself motivated and be conifedent that it 
       can be possible and achievable, and also to be humble enough to know that i will need help sometimes, and that is ok.

    </p>

<h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>

  <p>It will be consistency , time management , lack of concentration.</p>
