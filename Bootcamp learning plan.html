      <h2>Questions </h2>

  <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

   <h3>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for</h3>
    
    <p> I will be using it on every tasks or challenge that comes along with this part of course</p>

   <h3> What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy?</h3>
     <p> I would like to have that brilliant idea that is going to create or open a door of new opportunity
         for people, and make life easier for them. It sounds cheesy, but I want to have that knowledge that I made a difference in someone's life.
     </p>
  
     <h3>Do you have a destination in mind?</h3>

     <p>No , i don't have like a straight fully focus destination, at the very beginning of this journey, i just want opportunities, and i will always 
      grateful to have one that will lead to another one in the future </p>

  <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>

  <p> In terms of my strenghts, i will be determine to finish the tasks or challenge that we will be required to, 
      but also i will be always willing to be a good team player and listening as well as respect other people opinions and ideas</p>
  
  <p> In terms of my limitations, i think it will be my time management, because I have a job that demands 12hrs shift a day or night, 
      so i could be finding a little bit of difficulty orgnizing time to meet witgh others team mates, even sometimes not much time to finish my own tasks,
      but i will be doing my best to manage my time wisely</p>
