      <h2>What is Problem-Solving?</h2>
      <p>
        Problem-solving is the process of identifying, analyzing, and finding
        solutions to challenges or obstacles. It involves critical thinking,
        creativity, and decision-making skills to overcome difficulties and
        achieve desired outcomes.

    <section id="Encountered Problem" class="card">
      <h2>Facing a problem</h2>
      <p>
        In this time, i was dealing with some sort of coding exercise which it was a challenge as first time 
        encountering coding. I was supposed to put together a simple code that it would display pass or fail, 
        pass or fail on this challenge. By the time i got my code typed out, i could see it was not working.So 
        so i started to think what could be the problem, i went through my code line by line and i could not see 
        the error, so then i asked for to one the tutors, and when i compare his code with mine, i was able to 
        notice that i have a upper case letter instead of a lower case letter, so that was the problem.
        
        <h3>
         As a lesson on this exercise, i learned that simple mistakes like this one can get you stuck for a while,
        so is always good to take a break and come back with fresh eyes, or ask for help.</h3>
      </p>

      <p>
         On another opportunity, i was working on my blog page and I was making some arrangements on my CSS file ,
         trying to get my elements to align center, but i could not get it right. I was trying different ways to get it done,
         but nothing was working. So i decided before i started to get frustrated, i would do some research on the internet,
         i found a video that was explaining how to do it, and i followed the steps and it worked.
        
        <h3> 
          Definetely this time i learned that is always good to do some research, and try to find the answer before trying randomly, 
         without knowing what you are doing, because that can lead to more frustration.</h3>

      <h2>Techniques for Problem-Solving</h2>
      <p>
        There are several techniques and approaches to problem-solving,
        including:

    <section id="Critical" class="card">
      <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
      
      <p>
        Critical thinking is an essential skill for effective problem-solving.
        It involves analyzing information, evaluating evidence, and making
        reasoned judgments to arrive at logical conclusions.
        </nav>
      </p>
    </section>

    
    <section id="Collaboration" class="card">
      <h2>Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        Collaboration is often necessary for solving complex problems. Working
        with others allows for diverse perspectives, skills, and expertise to
        be leveraged in finding effective solutions.
      </p>
    </section>



  <section id="Pseudocode" class="card">
    <h1>Pseudocode</h1>
    <p>
      I have not put this into practice much at all yet, but is a way to plan your code using plain
      language before actually writing the code. It helps to outline the logic 
      and structure of the program, making it easier to translate into actual
      code later.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="Trying something"class="card">
    <h1>Trying something</h1>
     <p> More likely what i would multiple times before start looking or asking for help</p>
   </section>

  <section id="Ducky"class="card">
    <h1>Rubber ducky method</h1>
    <p id="ducky"> At this time or level, i would not have really clear from where to start debugging the code in order, 
      to find the error.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="Reading error messages"  class="card">
    <h1>Reading error messages</h1>
    <p> 
      I have been able to understand some error messages, but not all of them,
      so i still need to work on this skill. I think it will come with more practice and experience.
      sometimes the error messages are not very clear, so it can be challenging to understand what is wrong.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="Console.logging" class="card">
    <h1>Console Logging</h1>
    <p>
      I have to admit that i have not used this technique as much as i should, 
      but i know is a very useful tool for debugging and understanding the flow of the code.
    </p>
    
  </section>
  <section id="Googling"  class="card">
    <h1>Googling</h1>
    <p>
      Probably the most used technique by far, i have been able to find answers to many of my questions
      by searching on the internet. There are many resources available online, such as forums, tutorials,
      and documentation, that can help to solve problems and learn new skills.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="Asking"  class="card">
    <h1>Asking your peers for help</h1>
    <p>
      I have found that asking my peers for help can be very beneficial. Sometimes, a fresh perspective
      can help to identify the problem and find a solution more quickly. Additionally, discussing the problem
      with others can lead to new insights and ideas that may not have been considered otherwise.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="Asking coaches for help" class="card">
    <h1>Asking coaches for help</h1>
    <p>
      Probably one the first things i would do when i get stuck, is to ask for help to one of the coaches. 
      If i want to get an answer that , it wont be just an answer, but also an explanation of why is that way.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="Improving your process with reflection"  class="card">
    <h1>Improving your process with reflection</h1>
    <p>
      I think this is a very important step that i have not been doing enough. Reflecting on the problem-solving
      process can help to identify what worked well and what could be improved for future problems. It can also
      help to reinforce learning and build confidence in problem-solving skills.
    </p>
  </section>

 <section id="Reluctant to ask for help" class="card">
    <h2>Reluctant to ask for help</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes, i have felt reluctant to ask for help, not finding the way to express what i need, 
      or not wanting to bother others.
      On the other hand, when i have been stuck on something for a while, i feel like I just want to know the answer straight away,
      and  asking for help it is going to give that answer straight away, since i will have to go through the process of explaining
      how to get to the answer. I think that is maibly being a little impatient, and wanting to get the answer as soon as possible.
